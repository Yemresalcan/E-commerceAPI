# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a complete .NET 9 e-commerce solution built using Domain Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Clean Architecture patterns. The solution will provide a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready e-commerce platform with modern .NET 9 features, comprehensive testing, and containerized deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Architecture Implementation

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want a well-structured solution following DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture principles, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is created THEN it SHALL implement Domain Driven Design with proper aggregate boundaries
2. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL separate write operations using CQRS pattern
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL separate read operations using CQRS pattern
4. WHEN the solution is structured THEN it SHALL follow Clean Architecture with clear layer separation
5. IF a domain rule is violated THEN the system SHALL prevent the operation and return appropriate domain errors

### Requirement 2: Technology Stack Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the solution to use modern .NET 9 features and industry-standard libraries, so that the application is performant and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use .NET 9 framework with latest features
2. WHEN data persistence is needed THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL as the primary write database
3. WHEN caching is required THEN the system SHALL use Redis for performance optimization
4. WHEN read operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use Elasticsearch for fast querying
5. WHEN asynchronous messaging is needed THEN the system SHALL use RabbitMQ for event handling
6. WHEN request handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL use MediatR for CQRS pipeline
7. WHEN data mapping is required THEN the system SHALL use AutoMapper for object transformations
8. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use FluentValidation for input validation
9. WHEN logging is implemented THEN the system SHALL use Serilog for structured logging

### Requirement 3: Domain Model Implementation

**User Story:** As a domain expert, I want the business logic to be properly encapsulated in domain entities and aggregates, so that business rules are enforced consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Product aggregate is implemented THEN it SHALL include Product (root), Category, and ProductReview entities
2. WHEN the Order aggregate is implemented THEN it SHALL include Order (root), OrderItem, and Payment entities
3. WHEN the Customer aggregate is implemented THEN it SHALL include Customer (root), Address, and Profile entities
4. WHEN value objects are created THEN the system SHALL implement Money, Email, and PhoneNumber value objects
5. WHEN business operations occur THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate domain events
6. IF aggregate invariants are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent the operation and maintain consistency

### Requirement 4: CQRS Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want clear separation between command and query operations, so that read and write concerns are properly separated for scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN create or update operations are performed THEN commands SHALL write to PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN read operations are performed THEN queries SHALL read from Elasticsearch
3. WHEN domain events are raised THEN the system SHALL publish events to RabbitMQ
4. WHEN events are processed THEN event handlers SHALL update read models accordingly
5. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL use MediatR pipeline for request/response handling

### Requirement 5: API Layer Implementation

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want well-designed REST API endpoints with proper HTTP semantics, so that I can integrate with the e-commerce system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL follow REST conventions with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN requests are received THEN the system SHALL validate input using FluentValidation
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with meaningful messages
4. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence and Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data persistence with proper database configurations and migrations, so that data integrity is maintained across deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to PostgreSQL using Entity Framework Core 9
2. WHEN database schema changes are needed THEN the system SHALL support EF Core migrations
3. WHEN repository pattern is implemented THEN it SHALL provide abstraction over data access
4. WHEN Unit of Work pattern is used THEN it SHALL ensure transactional consistency
5. WHEN read models are updated THEN the system SHALL synchronize data with Elasticsearch

### Requirement 7: Cross-Cutting Concerns

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging, error handling, and monitoring capabilities, so that the system can be effectively maintained in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log structured information using Serilog
2. WHEN exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper middleware
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL provide health checks for all dependencies
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL use .NET configuration patterns
5. WHEN async operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use async/await throughout

### Requirement 8: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests, so that the system reliability can be verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL cover domain logic and business rules
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL verify API endpoints and database operations
3. WHEN test structure is implemented THEN it SHALL follow testing best practices
4. WHEN mocking is needed THEN tests SHALL use appropriate mocking frameworks
5. WHEN test data is required THEN tests SHALL use proper test data builders

### Requirement 9: Containerization and Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the entire solution containerized with Docker, so that deployment and scaling can be managed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containerization is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide Docker compose configuration
2. WHEN services are containerized THEN Docker compose SHALL include PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and RabbitMQ
3. WHEN the application is containerized THEN it SHALL have proper Dockerfile configuration
4. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL have proper health checks and dependency management
5. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear setup and deployment instructions

### Requirement 10: Modern .NET 9 Features

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want the solution to leverage modern .NET 9 features and performance improvements, so that the application is efficient and uses current language capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are defined THEN the system SHALL use primary constructors where appropriate
2. WHEN properties are declared THEN the system SHALL use required properties for mandatory fields
3. WHEN using statements are needed THEN the system SHALL use global using statements
4. WHEN LINQ operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use new LINQ methods where beneficial
5. WHEN performance is critical THEN the system SHALL leverage .NET 9 performance improvements
